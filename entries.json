Just because it already\nbegins with a reassurance that a solution exists.\nAnd when a solution exists, people run and chase to solve this puzzle because a solution exists. Seems rather funny if you think about it. But also makes sense?\nIf a predefined slot machine of this puzzle with finite giveaways is working well for long enough, it is logical to leave the worrying to someone else with some foresight to tell when to go do something else, like finding another slot machine? What if there won't be a slot machine anymore? What if an entire army evolves into being incapable of solving almost everything except the puzzle (just because a slot machine happened to be)\nLike a bacterial population selected to survive over generations with great fitness in this neatly\nprescribed rich broth, until one day someone messed up a few ions in the broth and half the species just disappeared"
