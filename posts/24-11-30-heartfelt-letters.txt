Heartfelt letters
---
For the longest time I have been wanting to write thoughtful letters/emails to anyone who might be willing to engage in slow patient beautiful conversations, the ones you are tempted to read over and over again, the ones you write most carefully laden with the weight of all you have to say but don't/can't, the ones that take long enough to reach to give one ample time to wonder what reactions their
words could possibly evoke in an anticipated reply

If this is something that interests you, reach out to me directly on akankshayadav58@gmail.com
(just a hi with the subject 'Heartfelt letters' is a valid reaching out :))
