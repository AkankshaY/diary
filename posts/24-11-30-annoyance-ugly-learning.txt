Getting good at something
---
Sometimes it's annoying to not be able to condense your own thoughts into a simple digestible biscuit of words.
Esp when it feels so satisfying to see how some people can bake almost anything into the perfect
biscuit (I only ever yearn for that crisp perfection as another quest in this life)

I have to say, that annoyance is the best kind though - it isn't undermining what I am already good at or anyone else is
It is looking at the beauty of something that we as humans have been able to finesse, recognizing that it takes a great deal of effort, and be willing to strive for it.
Annoyance is from realizing how unaesthetically I wield the power now (to write/speak for eg) so I have to watch this awkward gait I have until I learn to walk
