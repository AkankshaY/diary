Narration that took me by surprise
---
Depending on who you are,
I can tell the same story
effortlessly when the words themselves wouldn't weigh
too much
or
thoughtfully when the words would quickly adjust
themselves to my perception of your reception
or
excitedly when the words would race to the edge of my
lips and quickly escalate to something exquisite
And I will remember you
By the story you conjured out of me
