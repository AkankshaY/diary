What is to ever be home?
---
I have found a new home
And it's been a few weeks
Few weeks into
Breathing in this space,
I have cozied a bit
And moved the furniture around.
But a strange feeling lingers.
The thing is:
I don't know how to place myself
In a space I didn't create,
And call it home,
In an alien land,
All by myself and
My foolish dreams,
Even my desk too small to lay bare
All my thoughts.
