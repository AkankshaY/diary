You ever feel so lost because of the uncanny silence on the other end, every time you walkie-talkied (to) yourself, searching for this one desperate answer?
For the longest time, I had overlooked, disregarded even, that my inner voice can be ironically decisive in subtler ways than I thought (and only ever materializes vividly to keep me from the edge of a cliff, metaphorically).
It never announced this exuberant, momentous, epoch-defining revelation to me. In fact I feel utterly mistaken to have been looking for one, instead of trusting my fully capable instincts.
