Fearless hour
---
The lights are dim, the hour late,
And you have followed me into this hour
When my words are loose and unkept
Not with the slightest inclination to converse
The lights are dim, the hour late,
So I will smear any makeup and
dance loud and alone
on the thin line
Ugly, mad, sane and beautiful
All the same
