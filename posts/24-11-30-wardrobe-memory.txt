What's eating your working memory?
---
This was a fun question to think about - what aspect of your life is taking up most of your working memory?
(eg mine is all protocols, timelines and fine motor skills at this point)
(a year ago it was mostly all biorxiv, published papers, so I was super updated, not anymore)
Triggered by a realization that my wardrobe memory has gone down from nearly 100% to -20% in a specific period of time)
