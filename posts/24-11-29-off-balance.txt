Off-balance
---
The endless little imaginary stories
That creep up involuntarily
Like creepers climbing all over
Your neatly laid garden
When someone comes
And clips off a leaf.
It is then that you ought to look at the sun
And all that is brought to life
Again and again
Under its warm lasting light
