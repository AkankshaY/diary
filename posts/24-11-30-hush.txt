Hush, let the thousand flowers sing
---
Learning to hold words with a little extra room for delight, 
to let the thousand flowers, sing more profoundly in them
In such a way as to not impose my rendition 
of melody or joy or anything mine
I think it can bring a certain sadness in branding your joy as something that only you can afford
When it's easy and bad enough already to be convinced that joy comes in recognizably dogmatic shades of red, blue and green
