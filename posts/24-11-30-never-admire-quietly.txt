Never admire quietly

"If I admire something about someone, I tell them. We humans are so fragile. It's important we give people their flowers while they are still here. Never admire quietly" - Chimamanda Adichie

I have tried my best to abide by this very honestly as a sincere attempt to bring out more of the things I admire into the world. (I urge you to too!)
Fragile is not the word, blindedness is more like it - I feel "peculiarly good"/"different" is a quality hard to admit to oneself when it comes instinctively to the person but is not recognizably rare as such.
There's a reach/field of view different sets of people can be bound to, honest admiration affords
them your eyes and attention that have probably seen a completely different world than them. It can be empowering when such feedback allows the person to apply the right self corrective in the right direction!
