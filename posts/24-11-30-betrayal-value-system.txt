Betrayal of personal value system
---
I see two situations where one might be in a dilemma, battling with inner betrayal of their value system.

I. As arbiter of change
The first situation is where you are processing a change that you are undergoing in life and calling to question - why is the change happening and where is it coming from. Is it going against what is true to you because so far you have only played along the rulebook of your value system

II. Facing a befallen change
In the second case, it's an external unexpected change that occurred all of a sudden. (you are not the sole arbiter) It was something that affected you deeply and now there is no option but to cope with it. And it means that your emotions associated with that aspect has to evolve, change, unless one chooses to be in denial. Undergoing changes in emotion imposed mostly by circumstances from the outside also feels like a betrayal to that emotion itself, because you were so attached to it.
In this case it does feel unfair but there is no other way to move ahead. In fact this feeling of betrayal can act as a strong demotivating factor even, that why should you cope and why should you change your core value to something that you did not choose to change, it's just befallen you and
it would be in a way justified if you didn't want to accept that.
