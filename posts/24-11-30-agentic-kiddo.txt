Living way far away from reality
---
I have imagined this many a times just HOW impossible it seemed to me, how I could ever brings things I wanted to reality (truly nobody does until they do)
An agentic kiddo version of me would have known that objects that fly across the sky are things that humans like her build from scratch (and there was a time when they didn't, and then there was an order of things that fell in place over time) and that they could do it again and again and again much better, not just when the newspapers cared to mention it, and that we understood all of it from scratch and could change it the way we wanted it to.
And that you can't go out in the world and plant a seed of this object just because it made sense to you. That it's just a seed without knowing how to tend it AND that nobody does and most don't care. So you go out hunting, collecting all obscure skills in a bag, and gather an obscure army of others to help you do just that.
That's how some times things as big and as real as what we see come to be.
