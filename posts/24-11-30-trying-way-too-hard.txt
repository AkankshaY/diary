About trying way too hard

Watching someone throw their arms and legs in unnatural directions, like discomfort puppeted (is not a verb!) all over their body. Watching them bridge the irreconcilable, conspicuous gap between imitation and simply being. It's embarrassing, not apparent to the person, and rarely will anyone point out.
I am guilty of this, at some point you have been too!
Yet, I don't think there is any saving!
