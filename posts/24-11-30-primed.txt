It's amusing to think how dramatically one could affect the microcosm of a calm and collected bunch of cells - simply by priming them (w GPCRs) - with the benignity of being acutely aware of pain and pleasure. As if startled into a deluge of emotions, bathed in whatever the moment brings. As if touched gently by a sudden spark, and teleported to the heart of a bustling city.
Some crossroads come alive much the same - when once in a while, right in the middle of an ordinary life, when love gives us a fairy tale
