When it's past perigee
---
Inspired by relationships that begin with a looming expiry date, yet thrive gleefully against its backdrop of dread

Why am I looking at the clock
And raging at its guileless gait,
Troubled with the impending weight,
Of having to watch a pair of legs,
Inevitably recede,
Soon when it's past perigee
