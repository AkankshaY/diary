Pouring a person into a rigid mold of an idea of a relationship

It took me a while to realize that good relationships are never forged by casting its mold first and then pouring a person into it.
It also makes approaching new people so dreadfully difficult, this daunting feeling that no other human interaction can ever prepare you for it.
Every time I think about this, everyone close to me seems an incredibly fortuitous happening!
