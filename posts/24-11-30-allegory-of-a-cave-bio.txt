Allegory of a cave analogy in biology

This rabbit hole is a lost cause, so I'll just mention it (I LOST the figure and its reference to the Internet, also no Al was able to rescue with the vagueness)

If you think about it, all the techniques used in biology to "see' a cell are never able to capture everything/every instance of what you care, even at the highest resolution.
And it's extremely easy to overlook the experiment's time-space-context-condition dependence even after knowing that

* the rabbit hole began from finding a good paper that ranted about how arrows in biology are utterly meaningless, it's a symbolic jargon with a 100 context dependent meanings
