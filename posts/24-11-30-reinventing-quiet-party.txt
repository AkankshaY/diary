Reinventing the party as I would love

Set in a warmly lit place, every cocktail on the menu celebrating caffeine, single origin 90%+ dark chocolates lying around casually in every corner of the room, loose leafs of paper and Lamy fountain pens on the serving table to entertain your thoughts, open books spread across the table for your appetite, an open balcony to go stare at the sky and lose hours in wonderment
