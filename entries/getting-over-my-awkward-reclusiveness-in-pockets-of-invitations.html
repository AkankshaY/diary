            <h2 class="entry-title">Getting over my awkward reclusiveness in pockets of invitations</h2>
            <div class="entry-content">I really got over a lot of my awkward reclusiveness in front of the very few kind people who were willing to hear me out, like I had something meaningful to say.
I have had limited to very limited (single conversation) interactions with most of them, but it was profound in ways I only now realize.
So if I were to distill myself right now, I think 1/4th of me is influenced by my early life with
my family, but the rest has been shaped by a wide range of specific interactions with these generous people I have met since I left home.
So it's funny talking to my parents who only know the person who left home in '15, as I try to recollect how that person was back then.
