            <div class="entry-content">Something about a puzzle or a riddle is deeply satisfying and comforting. Just because it already
begins with a reassurance that a solution exists.
And when a solution exists, people run and chase to solve this puzzle because a solution exists. Seems rather funny if you think about it. But also makes sense?
If a predefined slot machine of this puzzle with finite giveaways is working well for long enough, it is logical to leave the worrying to someone else with some foresight to tell when to go do something else, like finding another slot machine? What if there won't be a slot machine anymore? What if an entire army evolves into being incapable of solving almost everything except the puzzle (just because a slot machine happened to be)
Like a bacterial population selected to survive over generations with great fitness in this neatly
prescribed rich broth, until one day someone messed up a few ions in the broth and half the species just disappeared</div>
