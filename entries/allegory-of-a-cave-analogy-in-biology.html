If you think about it, all the techniques used in biology to "see' a cell are never able to capture everything/every instance of what you care, even at the highest resolution.
And it's extremely easy to overlook the experiment's time-space-context-condition dependence even after knowing that

* the rabbit hole began from finding a good paper that ranted about how arrows in biology are utterly meaningless, it's a symbolic jargon with a 100 context dependent meanings</div>
