            <div class="entry-content">If you have never heard of it,
I will never pass up an opportunity,
To tell you that something, knowing that
That could have possibly changed
the entire trajectory of your life.
(because I believe it would)
(and just what are the odds!)
Like I almost owe it to you,
And how I would wrong the Universe,
And you, if I didn't
I ought to place such a beautiful thing,
Somewhere really close to your heart
(You see, it's only fitting)</div>
