            <div class="entry-content">Sometimes I brood over a conversation with a waitress who expressed great amount of surprise that I was not expecting anyone at my table.
A window table overlooking the street, couples passing by hand-in-hand, all the tables on the right, a third or fourth date on the table behind, and a big family celebrating in front.
A little while later, she came back hurriedly and hastily confessed,"I think this is lovely, it never
occurred to me, I should take time off and try it"

In that moment, there was a picturesque in my eyes that I just couldn't bestow on her - it lacked
any definition and no words came to rescue, so I just smiled back and she left just as quickly as she
came.</div>
